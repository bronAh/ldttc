# Learning Design for Teaching in a Tertiary Contextâ€”Elise Allen
## Assessment Task 1: The Learning Design Plan

### Part 2: The course components

#### f. Design overview
The learning design model on which this learning strategy is based is collaborative experiential learning. Kolb describes experiential learning as a process in which learning happens in a practical, shared way through iterations in which learners can modify their approach to problems according to experience gained through previous iterations and reflection (Kolb, 2015). In order to apply this in Professional Practice for IT, learners need to have the opportunity to undertake communicating and collaborating in teams more than once, with the opportunity to reflect on their performance at the end of each attempt with a view to improving their performance next time. Reflection is the key component here as it allows the experience to be converted to learning (Kolb, 2015). This can be tied to an educational trend of computing for social good, as the subject of the group work can be anything so long as it's relevant to IT (Goldweber et al., 2013). 

#### g. Learning strategy

The learning strategy will work like this: learners will be put into teams and given a social problem to solve, for example to reunite families after a natural disaster (Goldweber et al., 2013), and will work toward producing a report and presentation about their solutions. These deliverables are marked formatively, although this is part of a different learning strategy and beyond the scope of this paper. The point of this team activity is to learn team processes such as time management, task division and team communication, all of which are taught in a learning module that takes place before the team work exercise.

At the end of the team work, each learner will write their own reflection on what went well during the exercise and what could be improved, including their analysis of what they learnt and what they still need to learn about team work. After another module of learning in which more skills and knowledge about group work are explicitly taught, for example how to deal with conflict, new teams are given a new problem and are to produce another report and presentation about their solution.

# Learning Design for Teaching in a Tertiary Context
## Assessment Task 1: The Learning Design Plan

### Part 1: The learning design context and background

#### a. Introduction
This plan is for the redevelopment of Professional Practice for Information Technology, a level 5 course that is delivered to all first-year Bachelor of Information Technology students. The current version of the course was developed as a traditional communications theory course and consisted of lecture-style sessions with some blended learning in the form of online quizzes, with traditional assessments such as essays, formal reports and exams.

This plan aims to modernise the course by introducing learning strategies such as experiential learning, using professional portfolios for assessment and introducing more peer feedback and formative assessment. This design approach is appropriate in the context of this course and its containing programme because it reflects aspects of the collaborative workflows found in the IT industry as well as introducing students to performance criteria they will encounter later in the degree as well as in the workplace.

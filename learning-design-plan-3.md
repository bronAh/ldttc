# Learning Design for Teaching in a Tertiary Contextâ€”Elise Allen
## Assessment Task 1: The Learning Design Plan

### Part 3: Design for development, implementation and evaluation

#### l. Development
i. Where the sources of content for the previous version of the course were heavily weighted towards physical text books, this plan aims to be more flexible by introducing more of a variety of content sources. Of course it is still important to draw from books, journals and other printed material, but this will be combined with online documentation, videos such as TED talks and Lynda.com courses and interactive online tutorial applications. An example of the last is the interactive "git" tutorials widely available online for beginners to take a hands-on approach to learning about source code control.

ii. Activities will be developed less rigidly than they used to be. For example, instead of Word-document-based worksheets with step-by-step questions, activities will be designed to be flexible by using platforms like One Note Class Notebook. Collaborative experiential activities with team problem solving (i.e. group work) will be designed to focus on the processes, such as team decision making, rather than rigidly focussing on the steps needed to achieve the end goal.

#### m. Implementation

#### n. Resources

#### o. Evaluation

# Learning Design for Teaching in a Tertiary Contextâ€”Elise Allen
## Assessment Task 1: The Learning Design Plan

### Part 3: Design for development, implementation and evaluation

#### l. Development
i. Where the sources of content for the previous version of the course were heavily weighted towards physical text books, this plan aims to be more flexible by introducing more of a variety of content sources. Of course it is still important to draw from books, journals and other printed material, but this will be combined with online documentation, videos such as TED talks and Lynda.com courses and interactive online tutorial applications. An example of the last is the interactive "git" tutorials widely available online for beginners to take a hands-on approach to learning about source code control.

ii. Activities will be developed less rigidly than they used to be. For example, instead of Word-document-based worksheets with step-by-step questions, activities will be designed to be flexible by using platforms like One Note Class Notebook. Collaborative experiential activities with team problem solving (i.e. group work) will be designed to focus on the processes, such as team decision making, rather than rigidly focussing on the steps needed to achieve the end goal. These aspects of activity development are intended to account for cultural diversity in the learning approach.

#### m. Implementation
i. The implementation strategy will borrow from Backwards Design model whereby the parts are constructed in this order: identify and record the desired results, determine how to distinguish when the results are met and then design schedules and activities (Bowen, 2017). This framework can be used to design a timeline and define the order of the desired milestones.

**Milestones**
ii. The milestones as outlined in [Part 1](learning-design-plan-1.html) mostly come in at the last stage of the Backwards Design process: planning learning experiences and instruction. As the learning outcomes are already in place, the first step has been done. 

Thus, the first milestone to define in this plan is the assessment, or determining acceptable evidence (Bowen, 2017). This aligns to objective 4: designing assessments using portfolios. These must be completed before the course is delivered, so before the beginning of semester 1 2018 at the latest, but should be finished sooner so that there is time left to design the next step. This milestone will require writing an assignment brief, a rubric or marking schedule and perhaps finding or creating a model example. It also required deciding on what method will be used for hand-in and delivery of feedback (probably Moodle).

Next, aligning with objective 1, it would be a good idea to sketch out a course schedule. This will include the broad topic areas to be covered in each week of the course, and then a short list of topics for each session. This ensures that all the content and activities will fit into the semester. This will need to be completed by the end of January.

Lastly, aligning with objectives 2 and 3, lessons plans and activities probably need to be developed in parallel. This includes formative peer- and self-assessment opportunities and designing the collaborative experiential activities themselves.
